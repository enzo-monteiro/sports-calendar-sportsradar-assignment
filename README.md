This project is a sports calendar. 
It allows the user to view previous (and scheduled) sporting events, but also to add events themselves. 
As such, it has two views: the calendar view, and the "Add event" view. 
I kept it as simple and user-friendly as possible. My coding skills are limited so I did not do anything fancy; just straight-forward, clean code.
It runs well and the media-query and some of the CSS help it run on different screens. 
To run it, simply open the link. 
In terms of how it went and what my strategy was, like I said before, my goal was for it to be as direct and clean as possible. 
It's pretty barebones but, again, I'm new to coding so I did not want to attempt things that were too difficult for me; as it stands, I already had to use AI a decent amount (which I'll explain more in my AI document).
In conclusion, the calendar works and looks decent. That's what mattered to me.
